# X-Ray-Image-Classification

## Summary
The goal of this project is to use Deep Learning Neural Network to build an algorithm to classify a set X-rays images of pediatric patients to  help determine if whether or not pneumonia is present. The Neural Network chosen was the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as it is one of the preferred for image processing.

## What is Pneumonia?
Pneumonia is an infection that affects one or both lungs. It causes the air sacs, or alveoli, of the lungs to fill up with fluid or pus. Bacteria, viruses, or fungi may cause pneumonia. Symptoms can range from mild to serious and may include a cough with or without mucus (a slimy substance), fever, chills, and trouble breathing. How serious your pneumonia is depends on your age, your overall health, and what is causing your infection.
